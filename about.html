    <h1>About us</h1>

    <p>SSENSE, pronounced [es-uhns], is a Montreal-based fashion platform 
        with global reach. Founded in 2003, SSENSE is pacing the vanguard 
        of directional retail with a mix of luxury, streetwear, and avant-garde 
        labels. We produce industry-leading original content and take pride in 
        building our own technology solutions and systems from scratch. Our field 
        of focus has grown beyond that of a typical e-commerce entity as we explore 
        the nexus of content, commerce, and culture. Currently serving 150 
        countries, generating an average of 88 million monthly page views, 
        and achieving high double digit annual growth since inception, SSENSE 
        is becoming a cultural protagonist in its own right. </p>
